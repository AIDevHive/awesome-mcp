## What is MCP?

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) is an open protocol led by Anthropic that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. MCP defines a set of interfaces and protocols that allow developers to connect external data sources and tools with Large Language Models (LLMs) in a standardized way, promoting interoperability and scalability of the AI ecosystem. Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way for LLMs to get the context they need.
